\usage{
genesCoexSpace(objCOTAN, primaryMarkers, numGenesPerMarker = 25)
}
\arguments{
\item{objCOTAN}{a \code{COTAN} object.}

\item{primaryMarkers}{A vector of primary marker names.}

\item{numGenesPerMarker}{The number of genes correlated with the primary
markers that we want to consider. By default this is set to 25.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with:
\itemize{
\item the coex \code{data.frame}
\item a named \code{list} that for each secondary marker, gives the \code{list} of
primary markers that selected for it
\item a \code{data.frame} with the rank of each gene according to its pValue
}
}
\description{
To make the \code{GDI} more specific, it may be desirable to restrict
the set of genes against which \code{GDI} is computed to a selected subset, with
the recommendation to include a consistent fraction of cell-identity genes,
and possibly focusing on markers specific for the biological question of
interest (for instance neural cortex layering markers). In this case we
denote it as local differentiation index (LDI) relative to the selected
subset.
