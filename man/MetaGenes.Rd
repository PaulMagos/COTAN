\usage{
defineMetaGenes(
  points,
  maxDist = 15,
  minSize = 25L,
  maxSize = 100L,
  distance = "cosine",
  permutation = FALSE
)

metaGenesPlot(x, y, metaGenes)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{a \code{matrix} where each point is presented as a row}

\item{maxDist}{a maximum distance between two points inside a single
\emph{meta-gene}}

\item{distance}{the distance method to use. Default is \code{"euclidian"}}

\item{x}{an \code{array} giving the first coordinate of the points}

\item{y}{an \code{array} giving the second coordinate of the points}

\item{metaGenes}{a \code{list} of \emph{meta-genes}, such as the result of
\code{\link[=defineMetaGenes]{defineMetaGenes()}}. The union of all names in \code{metaGenes} must be a subset
of the names in the coordinates}

\item{minSize:}{the minimum size of a \emph{meta-gene}}

\item{maxSize:}{the maximum size of a \emph{meta-gene}}

\item{permute:}{a Boolean. When \code{FALSE} the points are used in the given
order as potential meta-genes centers, otherwise a random a permutation is
performed}
}
\value{
\code{defineMetaGenes()}returns a \code{list} of \emph{meta-genes}, each named after
its center gene. A \emph{metag-gene} is an array of gene names, thus making this
similar to a \link{ClusterList}

\code{metaGenesPlot()} returns a \code{list} with:
\itemize{
\item "plot" the wanted \code{ggplot}
\item "overlapping" an \code{array} that for each point gives how many
\emph{meta-genes} it belongs to; centers are returned with the highest value
}
}
\description{
A \emph{meta-gene} is a small group of genes deemed similar according
to some given distance. This grouping is intended to make less noisy and
more robust any procedure that would try to cluster cells based on coex
information
}
\details{
\code{defineMetaGenes()} groups together \emph{similar} genes into
\emph{meta-genes} according to the given distance. Usually the distance is based
on some function of the PCA of the genes

\code{metaGenesPlot()} shows the overlap of the points in the
\emph{meta-genes} in the given \eqn{(x, y)} space (usually the PCA)
