\usage{
defineMetaGenes(
  points,
  maxDist = 15,
  minSize = 25L,
  maxSize = 100L,
  distance = "cosine",
  permutation = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{a \code{matrix} where each point is presented as a row}

\item{maxDist}{a maximum distance between two points inside a single
\emph{meta-gene}}

\item{distance}{the distance method to use. Default is \code{"euclidian"}}

\item{minSize:}{the minimum size of a \emph{meta-gene}}

\item{maxSize:}{the maximum size of a \emph{meta-gene}}

\item{permute:}{a Boolean. When \code{FALSE} the points are used in the given
order as potential meta-genes centers, otherwise a random a permutation is
performed}
}
\value{
\code{defineMetaGenes()}returns a \code{list} of \emph{meta-genes}, each named after
its center gene. A \emph{metag-gene} is an array of gene names, thus making this
similar to a \link{ClusterList}
}
\description{
A \emph{meta-gene} is a small group of genes deemed similar according
to some given distance. This grouping is intended to make less noisy and
more robust any procedure that would try to cluster cells based on coex
information
}
\details{
\code{defineMetaGenes()} groups together \emph{similar} genes into
\emph{meta-genes} according to the given distance. Usually the distance is based
on some function of the PCA of the genes
