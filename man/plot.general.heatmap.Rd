\arguments{
\item{prim.markers}{A set of genes plottet as rows.}

\item{markers.list}{A set of genes plotted as columns.}

\item{dir}{The directory where the COTAN object is stored.}

\item{condition}{The prefix for the COTAN object file.}

\item{p_value}{The p-value treshold}

\item{symmetric}{A boolean: default False. If True the union of prim.markers and marker.list
is sets as both rows and column genes}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object
}
\description{
This function is used to plot an heatmap made using only some genes, as markers, and collecting all other genes correlated
with these markers with a p-value smaller than the set treshold. Than all relations are plotted.
Primary markers will be plotted as groups of rows. Marekers list will be plotted as columns.
