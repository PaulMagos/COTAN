\usage{
findSetsPoints(
  matrixPoints,
  maxDist = 15,
  minNumPointsSet = 25,
  maxNumPointsSet = 100,
  permutation = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrixPonts:}{matrix of points arranged in rows}

\item{maxDist:}{maximum distance between two points in a set}

\item{minNumPointsSet:}{minimum number of points in a set}

\item{maxNumPointsSet:}{maximum number of points in a set}

\item{permutation:}{if true, a permutation of the points is performed}
}
\value{
setsPoints:      output. list of lists, the names of the list are
the centers identified. The elements of one of the lists are the points
around the center of that list
}
\description{
this function subdivides the points of 'MatrixPoints' (arranged on the rows),
into sets based on the Euclidean distance that divides them.
