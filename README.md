# COTAN
Estimating co-expression of cell identity factors in single-cell transcriptomes is crucial to decode new mechanisms of cell state transition. Due to the intrinsic low efficiency of single-cell mRNA profiling, novel computational approaches are required to accurately infer gene co-expression in a cell population. We introduce COTAN, a statistical and computational method to analyze the co-expression of gene pairs at single cell level, providing the foundation for single-cell gene interactome analysis.
